# 🛣️ LeetCode Road: My Path to Algorithmic Mastery

**Public repository documenting my journey solving LeetCode problems**, analyzing patterns, and developing advanced skills in algorithms and data structures.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository aims to:
- **Strengthen** my technical interview and competitive programming skills.
- **Deeply Understand** common problem-solving patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Backtracking, etc.).
- **Write** clean, efficient, and professionally documented solutions.
- **Maintain** a public and transparent record of my technical growth.

Each category features its own `README.md` (Spanish) and `README_en.md` (English) detailing:
- **Key concept** and strategy.
- **Implementation** in TypeScript.
- **Big O Analysis** (Time and Space).
- **Common Pitfalls** to avoid.

## 🧠 Developing Skills

- **Pattern Recognition**: Instantly identify if a problem requires a Sliding Window or a Prefix Sum.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Rigorous evaluation of Time and Space (Big O).
- **Solution Optimization**: Systematically moving from Brute Force solutions to optimal approaches.
- **Clean Code**: Readable implementations in **TypeScript**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Main language for its strong typing and clarity.
- **Node.js**: Execution environment for local testing.
- **PNPM**: Efficient package manager.

### How to run the solutions
```bash
# Example:
node dist/sliding_window/best_time_to_buy/solution.js
```
> [!NOTE]
> Most solutions are designed to be run or pasted directly into the LeetCode judge.
